Generally, the Interior Design courses are the perfect fit for creative souls who enjoy planning and designing and have great taste . From the entire interior planning to furniture selection, interior designers are the go-to people for the clients so that they can enjoy a beautiful and comfortable living space. You can look forward to excellent earning opportunities after completing Interior Designer courses with decent salary packages. Short-term skill-based certificate and Diploma courses in Interior Designing can be worthwhile for students planning to start their professional journey early, are low on budget, and look at it more as a hobby or side income . On the other hand, if you're planning to start a healthy career journey in this field, it is better to go for full-fledged degree courses that focus both on theory classes and practical learning, along with skill development and connection building."

At the same time, functionality within the four walls matters. In cramped urban environments, it is harder to have a blend of both. A well-planned yet creative interior design achieves this much-needed balance. Interior design is the art of designing spaces that have a mixture of both aesthetic appeal and technical skills . It is the field of creating spaces that appeal to our senses while being practically useful. It refers to innovative and technical solutions for creating a purposeful environment within a house, room or any four-walled space. It can include the choice and placement of paintings, rugs, murals, furniture, wall colour, lighting, sculptures, organic or natural forms , and so on."

You don't just submit work and forget it — you keep reworking the same design after feedback, which really improves your thinking. Faculty push you a lot, sometimes it feels annoying, but later you realise why. The studio culture is intense near submissions, but very chill otherwise. You learn less from lectures and more from mistakes, discussions, and long studio hours. It's not fancy or easy, but if you stay involved, you genuinely improve.",
